was working in a seperate file and forgot to make a repository originally, so i moved those files into this folder.

I hope that works!!

steps taken.

I wasnt sure how to make the button work at first, so the first thing i did was make the empty array and and added the variables with lower, upper, numeric, and special characters.

next i made the cofirms push to the empty array. and used the console log to track what was happening.

added the math.floor/math.random to randomly select from the generatePassword array

added all this code to the function and it worked!! although I'm still not sure I understandy why...

changed Read Me to Steps
